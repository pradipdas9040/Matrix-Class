# Matrix-Class
C++ program for developing matrix class which can handle integer matrices of different dimensions. Now overload the operator +, -, and ==, such that if M1 and M2 are the objects of the class matrix, then M1+M2, M1-M2, M1==M2 behaves as addition, multiplication, and comparison of the two matrices.
